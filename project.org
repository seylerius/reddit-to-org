#+title: reddit-to-org â€” Gather Reddit saved items and output them for Org-mode
#+author: Seylerius

I have too much shit saved under Reddit. Only way to deal is programmatically.

* Reddit's data

** Reddit API

*** DONE Pick an API wrapper
CLOSED: [2016-08-03 Wed 20:49]

I'm basically looking at +mynx and+ [[https://clojars.org/markgunnels/reddit.clj][reddit.clj]], +and the former looks more mature+.

Yeah, going to have to go reddit.clj. Mynx unfortunately doesn't support the ~saved~ endpoint.

**** DONE Identify whether mynx paginates
CLOSED: [2016-08-03 Wed 20:48]

This is one of my main factors in the decision. Mynx is probably going to win either way, but if it unpaginates, then the win is automatic.

Yep, infinite lazy sequences. This is a point in its favor, and in favor of adopting it later to correct its deficiencies.

*** TODO Parse different content types

There are a few different content types in the saved Reddit posts: Links, Text posts, and Comments. They have a few fields in common:

+ ~:subreddit~
+ ~:link_id~

**** TODO Parse Links

These are links to something other than the post itself. Sometimes they're to another Reddit post, but mostly they're external. 

+ ~:domain~
+ ~:subreddit~
+ ~:url~
+ ~:title~
+ ~:id~

**** TODO Parse Text posts

These are bodies of markdown text. They link to themselves.

+ ~:domain~
+ ~:subreddit~
+ ~:url~
+ ~:title~
+ ~:selftext~
+ ~:id~

**** TODO Parse Comments

These are comments on existing posts. Their keys are different.

+ ~:subreddit~
+ ~:link_title~
+ ~:body~
+ ~:link_url~
+ ~:link_id~
+ ~:id~
+ ~:parent_id~

* Interface

** TODO Command line interface

*** TODO Pick a library

**** TODO Options?

*** TODO Input

**** TODO Auth

**** TODO Existing data

*** TODO Output

**** TODO Destination org-file
