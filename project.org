#+title: reddit-to-org â€” Gather Reddit saved items and output them for Org-mode
#+author: Seylerius

I have too much shit saved under Reddit. Only way to deal is programmatically.

* Reddit's data

** Reddit API

*** TODO Pick an API wrapper

I'm basically looking at [[https://clojars.org/mynx][mynx]] and [[https://clojars.org/markgunnels/reddit.clj][reddit.clj]], and the former looks more mature.

**** TODO Identify whether mynx paginates

This is one of my main factors in the decision. Mynx is probably going to win either way, but if it unpaginates, then the win is automatic.

*** TODO Parse different content types

There are a few different content types in the saved Reddit posts: Links, Text posts, and Comments. They have a few fields in common:

+ ~:subreddit~
+ ~:link_id~

**** TODO Parse Links

These are links to something other than the post itself. Sometimes they're to another Reddit post, but mostly they're external. 

+ ~:domain~
+ ~:subreddit~
+ ~:url~
+ ~:title~
+ ~:id~

**** TODO Parse Text posts

These are bodies of markdown text. They link to themselves.

+ ~:domain~
+ ~:subreddit~
+ ~:url~
+ ~:title~
+ ~:selftext~
+ ~:id~

**** TODO Parse Comments

These are comments on existing posts. Their keys are different.

+ ~:subreddit~
+ ~:link_title~
+ ~:body~
+ ~:link_url~
+ ~:link_id~
+ ~:id~
+ ~:parent_id~
